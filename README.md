A Brief description of myself

My name is Chi Kim. I'm 27. I was born in South Korea and came to the states when I was 12. 
I got a B.A degree in General Biology and minor in Microbiology at University of Washington and worked as a dental assistant for a few years after college. 
I'm currently working at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Instuitute as a Reserach Support Specialist. 
Although I love my current position at KPWHRI, I would like to advance if the opportunity comes. 
I do not have any prior experience in coding, but I'm excited to learn and improve my skill to be a successful future developer.
